Now when I look back to those days I can figure out how it shaped the future. Even after working on many cars, #59 still remains the best thing we ever built.",

    body: "A journey from a curious boy to a professional having some good knowledge in mechanical and automobile engineering this has never been successful without SAE,CET-B family. In shaping a good and purposeful engineering life the team has been a great support system and acted as family away from family. From getting so supportive seniors who played a great role as not less than family members during the worst phase of life and guiding well towards future goals to making myself a guide for upcoming batches this family has played an immense role. From a time when our seniors started the team at grassroot level and gave us confidence to excel well in such national level competition we have faced a roller coaster ride. As personal experience apart from technical aspect I have learnt and built interpersonal behaviours which helped me a lot to face not only the technical hurdles but also gave me confidence to take crucial decisions in a corporates and in life as well. Had I not been a member of this team it would have been much difficult to see myself where I have been now. More so not only a technical team but also as a family we have shared a great bonding and spent so many memories together which can hardly be explained with these limited words. The heavy emotion of failure to sharing the tears of happiness after seeing the vehicle competing in the track we have celebrated the outcome of torn jeans and sleepless nights. The best part of this 4 years' of journey was getting so wonderful seniors and batchmates who stood by each other through each thick and thin. We are happy and proud to see the juniors working so hard in order to keep a good track and continuous improvements. At the end of this I can just make this assure no matter how far we are or how busy life will be, we will be always available for this wonderful family's need and help with hope of seeing our next generations finishing on the podium at a greater level. With lots of love - Sudipta - RISE-RACE-RULE SAE,CET-B Forever!!",

Those interactions with seniors and juniors, those late night fabrication works, those wonderful get-togethers- pure 'goosebumps'. May it be presentations, searching for sponsorships, procurement, fabrications, vehicle testing or event trips- I have enjoyed each and every moment of my time in SAE. And last but not the least- the vehicles we created. They were not just vehicles, they were rather members of SAE. In the events we may not have possessed the best cars, but we definitely had the best teams. ‚ù§Ô∏è85 ‚ù§Ô∏è51 ‚ù§Ô∏èSAE",

Going together for the competition is a trip as well. We make great connections and friendship with versatile people from various colleges, states, even with intelligent minds. We learn professionalism and how to present ourselves, speak in front of a crowd, convince people and put ourselves at our best. Negotiations, marketing skills, selling skills, manufacturing techniques, alternatives technique etc.. This experience with technical and non technical work helps us get into core company placement as well. Yes, it's worth joining sae club.",

Apart from all this the national level competitions that we as a team took part in on behalf of SAE have added immense value to my resume and also have actually helped me ace in my job as well as premier college interviews. I would suggest all the upcoming SAE members to honestly give their heart and soul to the endeavours that SAE in venturing upon because those experiences are actually worthy both in professional and personal life.",
