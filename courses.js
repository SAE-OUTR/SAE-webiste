    details:"SolidWorks is a three-dimensional model-creation computer-aided engineering (CAE) and computer-aided design (CAD) tool. When compared to other CAD softwares, it is recognised as one of the top 3D modelling softwares for designing things with efficiency and convenience. SolidWorks software can handle everything from the earliest phase of design ideation to the execution of SolidWorks drawings and product manufacturing. This will aid in the delivery of innovative items at a faster rate because the design cycle will be shortened. SolidWorks in Engineering Design is widely utilised all over the world. Mechanical engineers and product designers utilise it to construct complex designs and test each component, guaranteeing that the result works as intended. SolidWorks Expert Certification can help you find your career path. Become a SolidWorks mechanical design expert.",

    details:"Ansys has shown to be the greatest solution for every type of engineering simulation since its inception in 1970. Ansys Workbench is used to virtually mimic the product's operating conditions, allowing us to better understand its behaviour and produce very good design results through simulation and optimization even before the product is manufactured. We may simulate problems from several domains such as structural, vibrations, heat transport, fluid flows, and many more using Ansys Workbench software. Our Ansys training course is designed to help you learn faster, enhance your skills, and remain up to date on the latest technologies.",
